The L game is a simple abstract strategy board
game invented by Edward de Bono.
It was introduced in his book
The Five-Day Course in Thinking (1967).
The L game is a two-player game played on a board of 4x4 squares.
Each player has a 3x2 L-shaped tetromino,
and there are two 1x1 neutral pieces.










His criteria in the development were:
-as few pieces as possible
-the smallest possible board
-as few rules, so it is easy to learn and play
